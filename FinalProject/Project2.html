        <h2> The Last Lecture </h2>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <div id = "#myID">After watching the Last Lecture I have a couple of different feelings and takeaways from the video.  First off, what affected me the most was how Pausch never gave up on his childhood dreams even through adulthood.  I know many people who have had childhood dreams including myself, who as they got older threw those dreams out simply because they seemed impossible.  Pausch didn’t seem to believe in impossible throughout his life, instead when faced with these blockages he found ways around them.  While he didn’t complete every single one of his childhood dreams such as the NFL dream, he still played football to try even when the going got tough.  Another thing that affected me was the final goodbye to those around him as a result of his cancer.  My father had cancer for the second time in 2017, and he spent the better part of the next two years teaching his kids about his dreams, his job, and the impact he made.  He himself created one Last Lecture through video for us to watch when we needed the advice, before passing away in the summer of 2019.  We heard about my father’s childhood dreams, his growing up, and people who were important to him.  This video really reminded me of everything I learned from him.  
            I really identify with Pausch’s message about brick walls.  He states that brick walls are there to stop those who are not serious about their dream.  Those who will not apply every aspect of themselves to achieve what they want, this separates the dreamers from the doers.  If everything was too easy, then would we as humans really be motivated to do better?  We would not grow, we would not learn that sometimes the path best taken has the most turns, and we certainly wouldn’t be as advanced as we are today.  Brick walls are there to make us better, to motivate us, to push us out of our comfort design and make us think about what we really want.  Everyone’s going to face brick walls, they are unavoidable and simply a part of life.  It helps us appreciate how far we’ve gotten, and even when getting around the blockage is tough, it makes the journey on the other side that much more meaningful.</div>

        <h2>Learning Styles</h2>
        <hr />
        <br />
        <div id = "#myID">The three learning styles are auditory learning, kinesthetic learning, and visual learning.  Visual learners learn through seeing such as videos, graphics, and visual examples that they can watch.  Kinesthetic learners learn through getting a feeling for something whether it be on a physical and/or an emotional level.  Finally, auditory learners are best at learning through hearing information and spoken instructions.  It isn’t always easy to find what learning style is yours especially in very closed-minded atmospheres.  However, learning styles certainly affect how one learns.  If you’re shoved into a school where you attend 8 classes a day, that enough is a lot in itself.  However, if all of these classes teach with a learning style which does not resonate with you then it can be harder to retain information and keep interest in classes which can negatively affect one’s grades.  While you may memorize the content you are supposed to for the test, you will not be truly learning which can negatively impact your progress and education in the future.  Instead, if the classes have a learning style which fit one that works for you, you’ll be able to learn the information you’re supposed to and keep interest in the classes you are taking.  Memorizing content and learning are two very different things, while one lets you get by, the other is needed to truly grow and make the most out of your education.  Learning styles can make or break a classroom and its progress. </div>
